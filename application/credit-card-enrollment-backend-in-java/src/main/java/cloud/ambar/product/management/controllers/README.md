Spring Boot controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests in a web application. They map incoming requests to 
specific methods, which process the request and return a response. In a typical Spring Boot application, controllers 
manage the routing and orchestration of actions based on the type of request (e.g., GET, POST).

In a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) EventSourcing system, Spring Boot controllers can serve as the entry 
point for commands. Commands represent actions or changes requested by users, such as creating or updating an entity. 
Controllers receive these commands via HTTP requests (e.g., POST), validate the input, and pass the command to the 
appropriate service or command handler.

The command handler then processes the command by making changes to the system's state (e.g., updating an event store). 
This separation of concerns helps maintain a clean architecture, where controllers are responsible only for receiving 
and routing commands, while the actual command processing logic resides in the service or domain layer.
