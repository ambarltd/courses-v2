A Command Handler Service in a CQRS EventSourcing system is responsible for processing commands by executing the business 
logic associated with state changes. When a command is received, the service first performs validations to ensure the 
command is valid and consistent with the current state of the system.

To do this, the service reads past events from the event store to hydrate an aggregate, which represents the entity's 
state by applying a sequence of past events. Once the aggregate is rebuilt, the command handler checks for any business 
rules or constraints (e.g., ensuring an order hasnâ€™t already been completed or that an account has sufficient balance).

If all validations succeed, the command handler generates a new event reflecting the state change requested by the command. 
This event is then written back to the event store, allowing the system to evolve while maintaining a full history of 
all changes.

By separating the validation logic and event generation into this service, the command handler ensures both data 
integrity and business rule enforcement in an event-sourced system.
