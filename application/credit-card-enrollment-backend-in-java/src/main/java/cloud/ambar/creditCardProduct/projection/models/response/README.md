Tracking events in an EventStore for new events, filtering and forwarding them to downstream consumers while maintaining
ordering and delivery guarantees can be complex and error-prone. Event buses such as RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka are often
used to transmit and deliver events but can be complex to configure, manage, and scale.

Ambar is a data streaming service that empowers you to build mission-critical real-time applications in minutes. Instead 
of producing to and consuming from message brokers, Ambar pulls records from databases, such as EventStores and pushes 
records to application endpoints like your projection and reaction handlers.
