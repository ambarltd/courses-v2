In a CQRS and EventSourcing system, an aggregate plays a crucial role by handling commands and applying state changes 
based on past events. When a command is received, the aggregate is hydrated by replaying the relevant events from the 
event store to rebuild its current state. The aggregate is used to validate the command, apply any necessary changes, and 
produces new events that reflect the state transitions.

This pattern ensures that the aggregate maintains integrity while supporting event-sourced models where past events are 
the authoritative source of truth.
